This segment is expected to witness a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.5% from 2023 to 2030, driven by the increasing demand for fuel-efficient vehicles and advancements in steering technologies.</p><h2>SUV EPS Market, By Application Segmentation</h2><p>The segmentation of the SUV EPS market by application primarily focuses on passenger vehicles and commercial SUVs. Passenger vehicles are witnessing a higher adoption of EPS systems due to their enhanced steering capabilities, improved fuel efficiency, and increased driver comfort. The growing consumer preference for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) also boosts the demand for EPS in this segment, as these systems often rely on electric steering for optimal performance. The rising trend of vehicle electrification is further propelling the integration of EPS in passenger SUVs, making them a more attractive option for manufacturers aiming to meet sustainability goals.</p><p>On the other hand, commercial SUVs are also gradually integrating EPS technology, though the adoption rate is currently slower compared to passenger vehicles. The need for improved maneuverability and control in larger vehicles is driving the demand for EPS in this segment. Moreover, the increasing emphasis on enhancing safety features and reducing vehicle weight is making EPS an appealing option for manufacturers of commercial SUVs. As regulatory standards for vehicle efficiency and emissions become more stringent, the incorporation of EPS systems in commercial applications is expected to gain momentum, contributing to the overall market growth.</p></h3><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;SUV EPS Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>JTEKT</Li><Li> Bosch</Li><Li> NSK</Li><Li> Nexteer</Li><Li> ZF</Li><Li> Mobis</Li><Li> Showa</Li><Li> Thyssenkrupp</Li><Li> Mando</h3><h3 id="ember53" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Global&nbsp;SUV EPS Market Segmentation:</h3><p id="ember54" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Segmentation analysis involves dividing the market into distinct groups based on certain criteria, such as type and application.
